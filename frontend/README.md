# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Axios
- Used for sending HTTP requests

### Frontend Testing
#### React Testing Library 
- Lightweight solution for testing React components
- Provides light functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils
- Primary guiding principles:
    - 'The more your tests resembles the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.'
- The React Testing Library is not:
    - A test runner or framework
    - specific to a testing framework
